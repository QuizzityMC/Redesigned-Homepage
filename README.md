## The old (but redesigned) pages for Canary Chat

These were used by us when we still used Nerimity as a baseline - but they were in typescript and this is completely reworked! 

## How to use?

Edit the files index.html (homepage) register.html (register) and login.html (login) pages as you like. You can also replace logo.png.  (In fact you can edit everything ðŸ˜Š ) 

## How to install

Just fork the repo, and use with Github Pages or any other static host.
